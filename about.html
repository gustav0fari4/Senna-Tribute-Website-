                    <p>My name is Gustavo Faria, I am 30 years old and I am from Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
                    <p>I love footbal and video games. Also, I spend my free time with my wife going to the cinema, restaurants or travelling.</p>
                    <p>I have been living in Dublin for about 5 years.</p>
                    <p>I consider Senna my hero because he was widely recognized for his extraordinary talent as a Formula 1 driver. His exceptional skill behind the wheel and unwavering determination to win made him an icon of the sport. Senna's courage and boldness in facing challenges on the racetrack were unmatched. He executed daring overtakes and handled adverse track conditions with finesse, embodying a 'NEVER GIVE UP' mindset that not only inspired myself but countless others around the world. Senna served as a beacon of inspiration, not just for me, but for many. His influence extended beyond his sporting achievements to his life philosophy. He frequently shared messages about overcoming adversity, perseverance, and striving for excellence, motivating others, including myself, to pursue our goals and dreams relentlessly.</p>
                    <p><em>"And so you touch this limit, something happens and you suddenly can go a little bit further. With your mind power, your determination, your instinct, and the experience as well, you can fly very high."    Ayrton Senna</em></p>
